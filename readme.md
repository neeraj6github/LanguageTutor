‚öôÔ∏è Gemini API Integration
Our AI chat responses are powered by Google Gemini API, enabling natural and intelligent replies.

How it works:
User submits a chat message in the frontend.

Frontend sends the message to the backend API.

Backend formats the prompt and sends a POST request to the Gemini API endpoint.

The request includes the prompt and the Gemini API key stored securely in environment variables (.env).

Gemini API returns a plain-text reply.

Backend forwards this reply to the frontend chat UI.

Frontend displays the response, including proper formatting for code blocks.
